## Full-Stack Software Engineer| Django • React • TDD Enthusiast | Based in Sweden 🇸🇪 | Open to roles in SE & DK & HU & FN & EN

👋 Hi, I’m Balázs Bencs (@bencsbalazs)

💡 I'm a passionate **full-stack software engineer** who thrives on creating robust, scalable, and modern solutions. I'm a strong believer in clean code, agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban), and continuous learning. My focus is on building end-to-end web applications, from a polished frontend to a reliable cloud infrastructure.

📍 I'm currently based in Malmö, Sweden and working in Lund. I'm **open to work** and happy to relocating to opportunities in Sweden, Denmark, Hungary, Finland or other countries. I prefer the office work.

🎯 I’m interested in blades, card games, board games, karate, GeoCaching, hiking, driving, and lifelong learning. (just after development)

🌱 I’m currently diving deep LLM-s, Tensorflow and Communication skills.

🚀 I’m actively looking for a new job opportunity where I can grow, contribute, and be part of a meaningful team.
